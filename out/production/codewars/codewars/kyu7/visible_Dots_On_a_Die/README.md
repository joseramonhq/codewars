<p>6, 8, 10, 12, 20 sided dice are the possible inputs for "numOfSides" </p>
<p>topNum is equal to the number that is on top, or the number that was rolled.</p>
<p>for this exercise, all opposite faces add up to be 1 more than the total amount of sideshttps://www.codewars.com/kata/5a39724945ddce2223000800
  Example: 6 sided die would have 6 opposite 1, 4 opposite 3, and so on.
for this exercise, the 10 sided die starts at 1 and ends on 10.</p>
<p>Note: topNum will never be greater than numOfSides</p>
