<p>Peter enjoys taking risks, and this time he has decided to take it up a notch!</p>
<p>Peter asks his local barman to pour him <strong>n</strong> shots, after which Peter then puts laxatives in <strong>x</strong> of them. He then turns around and lets the barman shuffle the shots. Peter approaches the shots and drinks <strong>a</strong> of them one at a time. Just one shot is enough to give Peter a runny tummy. What is the probability that Peter doesn't need to run to the loo?</p>
<h2 id="task">Task</h2>
<p>You are given:</p>
<p><strong>n</strong> - The total number of shots.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong> - The number of laxative laden shots.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong> - The number of shots that peter drinks.</p>
<p>return the probability that Peter won't have the trots after drinking. <strong>n</strong> will always be greater than <strong>x</strong>, and <strong>a</strong> will always be less than <strong>n</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You must return the probability rounded to two decimal places i.e. 0.05 or 0.81</strong></p>
