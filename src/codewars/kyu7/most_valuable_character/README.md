The value of a character is the difference between the index of its last occurrence and the index of its first occurrence. Return the character that has the highest value. If there is a tie, return the alphabetically lowest character. <code>[For Golang return rune]</code></p>
<p>All inputs will be lower case. </p>
<pre><code>For example:
solve('a') = 'a'
solve('ab') = 'a'. Last occurrence is equal to first occurrence of each character. Return lexicographically lowest.
solve("axyzxyz") = 'x'
</code></pre>
<p>More examples in test cases. Good luck!</p>
