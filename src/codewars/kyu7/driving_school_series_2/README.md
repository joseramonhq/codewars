<p></p><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Time</th>
    <th>Cost</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Up to 1st hour</td>
    <td>$30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Every subsequent half hour**</td>
    <td>$10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><h6>** Subsequent charges are calculated by rounding up to nearest half hour.</h6></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>


<p></p><p>For example, if student X has a lesson for 1hr 20 minutes, he will be charged $40 (30+10) for 1 hr 30 mins and if he has a lesson for 5 minutes, he will be charged $30 for the full hour. 

</p><p>Out of the kindness of its heart, F&amp;F also provides a 5 minutes grace period. So, if student X were to have a lesson for 65 minutes or 1 hr 35 mins, he will only have to pay for an hour or 1hr 30 minutes respectively. </p>
<p>For a given lesson time in minutes (min) , write a function <i>cost</i> to calculate how much the lesson costs. Input is always &gt; 0.</p>
