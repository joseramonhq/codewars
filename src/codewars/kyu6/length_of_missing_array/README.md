<div class="w-full panel bg-ui-section"><h1><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/57b6f5aadb5b3d0ae3000611" target="_blank">Length of missing array
</a></h1><h3 class="wf-title-alt">Description:</h3><div class="markdown prose max-w-5xl mx-auto overflow-x-auto break-words" id="description"><p>You get an array of arrays.<br>
If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.<br>
But one array is missing!<br>
<br><br>
You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.<br></p>
<pre><code>Example:
[[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<br>

<p>If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.<br></p>
<p>When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!<br>
There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)<br>

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.</p>
